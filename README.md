# SpatialOS demos

This is a repository to hold simple SpatialOS demos.  Currently it is focused on
demonstrating usage of SpatialOS "bare metal" APIs.

As of mid-2018, most existing public SpatialOS tutorials assume that developers
are interested in a Unity-centric workflow.  Even the [C++ worker
tutorial][cpp-worker-tutorial] assumes that you have started with their Unity
pirates tutorial.  This is great if you want to get up and running with a game
quickly, but if you want to understand the SpatialOS computational model and
APIs, it may be helpful to see something built "from scratch" directly on
SpatialOS APIs alone.

This repo was forked from [spatialos-empty-project][spatialos-empty-project];
see that project's README.md for details.
